Project for front-end development of the website of the [WSU Academic Success and Career Center (ASCC)](https://ascc.wsu.edu).

## Project Description
This project tracks development of the precompiled Less CSS, compiled custom CSS, built custom JS, JSON, and HTML5 code from which pages, posts, forms, and tables belonging to the ASCC website are constructed, styled, and rendered more interactive via the [WSUWP platform](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/wsuwp-platform).
