					<h3 class="h5-fs sv--0mx">Internet Capabilities</h3>
					<p>Attending <a href="https://www.simplemost.com/companies-offering-free-internet-students/">online classes</a> are important. We have heard from a few students that they are dealing with weak internet capabilities and are having difficulty attending classes and Zoom meetings. If you are in this situation, there are several companies that are offering discounts or free service to students affected by COVID-19. This previously linked article may be helpful.</p>
					<p>We suggest checking with your local internet service providers to see what offers they are making available to students. Here are some that we found:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/">Spectrum</a> – Offering Free internet for 60 days to college students</li>
						<li><a href="https://news.centurylink.com/covid-19">Centurylink</a> – Suspending data usage limits for current customers</li>
						<li><a href="http://one2one.sparklight.com/sparklight-offers-low-cost-internet-to-assist-families-in-need-during-coronavirus-covid-19-crisis/">Sparklight</a> – Offering unlimited data on all internet services</li>
